Petal Width:
Setosa is clustered around the lower range, with a peak frequency near the lower portion
of the range of the petal width. This shows there is minimal variation in this species.
Versicolor is more spread out compared to Setosa. While Virginica is even more spread 
out. Both of these show more variation with the data spread out and no one bin having a
super higher frequency.

Setosa is clearly separated from Versicolor and Virginica due to its extremely narrow 
range of petal widths. There is some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica, but 
Virginica tends to have larger petal widths overall. Petal width appears to be a strong
feature to distinguish Setosa from the other two species.

Petal Length:
Again Setosa's distribution is narrow with their petal lengths clustered around the lower
range. The max frequency (the peak) is concentrated within the middle pf the distribution. 
For Verscicolor the distribution spans a wider range, overlapping with Virginica on the 
higher side of the range. Virginica is also distributed and varied more across a bigger
range. 

Setosa is clearly distinct in terms of petal length, showing no overlap with Versicolor
or Virginica. There is a small amount of overlap between Verscicolor and Virginica. 
Petal length is a great way to distinguish Setosa from the other two species. While there 
is some overlap between the other two, the bigger range of Virginica shows some separation.
