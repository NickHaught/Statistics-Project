Exploratory data analysis

1. Comments on separation of species

Petal length and petal width:
Setosa shows a clear separation from Versicolor and Virginica with smaller values 
for both petal length and petal width. Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap, 
but there is obvious visible clustering. Virginica generally has larger petal lengths 
and widths then Versicolor. 

Sepal length and sepal width:
Theses data points show more overlap, especially with Versicolor and Virginica, making 
them less effective for species separation. Though Setosa still shows clear separation,
with more higher sepal widths and lower sepal lengths compared to the other two 
species.  

Sepal length and petal length:
Setosa shows a clear separation from both Versicolor and Virginica, specifically with 
its characteristic of shorter petals. Versicolor and Virginica have more overlap, but
Virginica tends to have higher petal lengths compared to Versicolor. 

Sepal width and petal width:
Setosa shows a clear separation with smaller petal widths and higher sepal widths
compared to Versicolor and Virginica. Versicolor and Virginica show overlapping, though
Virginica tends to have larger petal widths. 

Findings: 
Setosa is easily separable from Versicolor and Virginica in all scatt plots due to its
smaller petal dimensions and larger sepal widths. Versicolor and Virginica overlap in 
moss plots, but observable differences in petal dimensions provide the best separation
between the two species. Petal dimensions are the best for distinguishing species.
